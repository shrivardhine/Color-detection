Image Color Detection with OpenCV and Pandas

This project allows you to detect the color of any pixel in an image by double-clicking on it. The program reads an image and a CSV file containing color names and their corresponding RGB values. When you double-click on any pixel in the image, the program identifies the closest matching color and displays its name along with the RGB values. This is achieved using the OpenCV library for image processing and Pandas for handling the color data.
